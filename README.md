# React + Vite

**This is a compound interest calculator**

It calculates the amount of compound interest the user will get based of the initial amount they input, monthly contributions they want to put in, interest rate of their choice, and number of years they want to compound.

Once all of the input fields are finalized, the user can click the 'How rich will I be?' button, which will then calculate the amount they will have based of their inputs, the amount without the compounding, and the difference between the two.

Finally, there is a reset button so that the user is able to put in another fictional scenario.







This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
